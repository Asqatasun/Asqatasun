# Use Asqatasun with Docker

## Single container
- This is a fat container, that is absolutly not compliant to [Docker best-practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/)
- Don't use it for production as all data are wiped out at reboot / rebuild
- BUT for quick testing, that does the job :)


##  Multiple containers

Work in progress
