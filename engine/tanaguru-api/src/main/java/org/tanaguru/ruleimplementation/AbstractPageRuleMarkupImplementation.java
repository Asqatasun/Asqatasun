 * This class should be overriden by concrete {@link RuleImplementation} classes

 * method defines 2 commons actions when testing a page : 
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>selection</li>
 *  <li>check</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  This class implements the {@link ElementHandler} interface to handle the selected 
 *  elements of the selections. <br/>
 *  The concrete implementation may need to use local instances of {@link ElementHanlder}
 *  implementation when multiple selection is needed.
