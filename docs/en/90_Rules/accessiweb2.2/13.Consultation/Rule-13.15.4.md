 * The added up total area of the effects is less than or equal to 21 824 pixels

Level : Bronze

## Technical description

Scope : Page

Decision level : Semi-decidable

## Algorithm

### Selection

Selection1 : All the `applet` tags

### Process

The selection handles the process.

For each occurence of the Selection1 raise a MessageA
###### MessageA : Check Manually the elements

    code :ManualCheckOnElements
    status: NMI
    parameter : snippet, `code` attribute
    present in source : yes

### Analysis

#### Not Applicable

Selection is empty (The page has no `applet` tag)

#### Pre-qualified

The selection is not empty
