Criterion : 11.3

Test : [11.3.1](http://www.accessiweb.org/index.php/accessiweb-22-english-version.html#test-11-3-1)

Test description :

Level : Silver

## Technical description

Scope : page

Decision level :
semidecidable

## Algorithm

### Selection

All the `form` tags with child `label` tags

### Process

The selection handles the process.

For each occurence of the selection raise a MessageA

###### MessageA : Check Manually the elements

-   code :ManualCheckOnElements
-   status: NMI
-   parameter : tag name
-   present in source : yes

### Analysis

#### Not Applicable

Selection is empty (The page has no `form` tag with `label` tag as
child)

#### Pre-qualified

The selection is not empty

## Notes

-   We only detect the elements of the scope of the test to determine
    whether the test is applicable
-   We assume here that the raised messages focus on the `form` element
    and not on the `label` elements
