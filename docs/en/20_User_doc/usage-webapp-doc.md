# Usage of Asqatasun web application

Asqatasun is now available at the URL you set up for the "**--tanaguru-url**" installation script option.

You may additionnaly place an Apache in front of Tomcat, and connect them with mod_proxy_ajp.

Any change of the network configuration (change of hostname, application of domain) would imply a modification of the "**web-app-url**" property in the /etc/asqatasun/asqatasun.conf file
